					<p>Where the Sal forest of the Chitwan jungle meets the wild and beautiful valley of the Rapti river, the world is wild and splendid. Broad grassland sweeps the north to the Mahabharata range and virgin jungle extends to the Churia hills. For centuries the dense jungle bordering on the foothills of the Himalayas formed an impenetrable barrier, keeping Nepal a hidden and mysterious country. The last three decades have seen that barrier breached, but the jungle of the Chitwan National Park remains a world apart. Here the spirit of great explorers and adventurers still lives</p>
